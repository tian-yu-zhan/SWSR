This is a help file for the R code accompanying a paper with the title “Semiparametric Weighted Spline Regression (SWSR) in Confirmatory Clinical Trials with Time-Varying Placebo Effects”.
The simulation is conducted on cluster with 120 cores under 10^5 or 10^6 iterations. For testing on local laptop, one can use 10^3 iterations.

•	In the folder “1_un”, the R code “TD_1_un” is to generate results under unequal-variance in Table 2, Web Table 3 and Web Table 4. 
•	In the folder “2_eq”, the R code “TD_2_eq” is to generate results under equal-variance in Table 1, Web Table 1 and Web Table 2. 
•	In the folders “3_com_un” and “4_com_eq”, the R code “TD_3_com_un” and “TD_4_com_eq” are to generate results in Table 3.  
•	In the folder “5_real”, the R code “TD_5_real” is to generate results in Table 5. 
•	In the folder “6_error”, the R code “TD_6_error” is to generate results in Web Table 7.
•	In the folder “7_pspline”, two R code files generate results in Web Table 5.
•	In the folder “8_enroll”, the R code file generates results in Web Table 6.
